## Installation

First, make sure your computer has [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) and [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) installed.

Then, clone the repository by running the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/fzmi/pillx.git
cd pillx
```

Next, install the Expo CLI and project dependencies:

```
yarn global add expo-cli
yarn install
```

If the first command encountered permission issues, run `sudo yarn global add expo-cli` instead and then enter your computer password when prompted.

Finally, host the project locally by running:

```

```
